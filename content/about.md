<!-- Welcome! I intend to dissect and understand the anatomy of the Machine Learning Lifecycle, viewing it through two crucial lenses: Research and Engineering.
In my early days of working on local machines and school projects, I never fully grasped the distinct nature of ML Research and Development. Among many other factors, as data scales and model complexity grows, these two aspects of the ML lifecycle diverge, each unveiling its own domain of intricacies.
By meticulously examining each stage from these distinct perspectives, I aim to provide a comprehensive understanding that balances breadth and depth.

Join me on this journey as we explore the fascinating interplay between cutting-edge research and practical engineering in the ever-evolving world of machine learning! -->
